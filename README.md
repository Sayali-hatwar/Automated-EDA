# Automated-EDA
Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the use of software tools and algorithms to perform data exploration, analysis, and visualization automatically without the need for manual intervention. The goal of automated EDA is to streamline the process of understanding the characteristics and patterns within a dataset, enabling data scientists and analysts to gain insights quickly and efficiently. Several tools and libraries have been developed to automate various aspects of the EDA process.

Popular libraries and tools for automated EDA include:

ydata Profiling: Provides an automated report with statistics, visualizations, and insights about a DataFrame.
Sweetviz: Generates high-density, informative visualizations for comparing two datasets.
Autoviz: Automatically visualizes datasets using various charts and plots.
Dtale: It provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface for exploring, visualizing, and understanding datasets. 

Automated EDA tools can save time in the initial stages of data exploration, allowing data scientists and analysts to quickly understand the structure and characteristics of a dataset before diving into more detailed analysis or modeling.
